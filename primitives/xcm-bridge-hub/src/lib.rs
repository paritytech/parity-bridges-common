	// 1) we now close the associated outbound lane when misbehavior is reported. If we'll keep
	//    handling inbound XCM messages after the `suspend_inbound_channel`, they will be dropped
	// 2) the sender will be able to enqueue message to othe lanes if we won't stop handling inbound
	//    XCM immediately. He even may open additional bridges

	/// Stop handling new incoming XCM messages from given bridge `owner` (parent/sibling chain).
	///
	/// We assume that the channel will be suspended immediately, but we don't mind if inbound
	/// messages will keep piling up here for some time. Once this is communicated to the
	/// `owner` chain (in any form), we expect it to stop sending messages to us and queue
	/// messages at that `owner` chain instead.
	///
	/// This method will be called if we detect a misbehavior in one of bridges, owned by
	/// the `owner`. We expect that:
	///
	/// - no more incoming XCM messages from the `owner` will be processed until further
	///  `resume_inbound_channel` call;
	///
	/// - soon after the call, the channel will switch to the state when incoming messages are
	///   piling up at the sending chain, not at the bridge hub.
	///
	/// This method shall not fail if the channel is already suspended.

	///
	/// This method is called when the `owner` tries to resume bridge operations after
	/// resolving "misbehavior" issues. The channel is assumed to be suspended by the previous
	/// `suspend_inbound_channel` call, however we don't check it anywhere.
	///
	/// This method shall not fail if the channel is already resumed.
