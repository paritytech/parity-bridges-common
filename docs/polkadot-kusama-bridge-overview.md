# Polkadot <> Kusama Bridge Overview

This document describes how we use all components, described in the [High-Level Bridge Documentation](./high-level-overview.md),
to build the XCM bridge between Kusama and Polkadot. In this case, our components merely work as a XCM transport
(like XCMP/UMP/HRMP), between chains that are not a part of the same consensus system.

The overall architecture may be seen in [this diagram](./polkadot-kusama-bridge.html).
