# we need to be able to work with XCMv3, but it is not yet in Polkadot master
# => manual patch is required. Because of https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5478
# we need to use double slash in the repo name.
#
# Once XCMv3 PR is merged, we may remove both Substrate and Polkadot patch section.
