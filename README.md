# Parity Bridges Common

This is a collection of components for building bridges.

The main components that will be constructed here will be bridge modules/runtimes
and bridge relays.

ðŸš§ The bridges are currently under construction - a hardhat is recommended beyond this point ðŸš§

## Substrate Node
The Substrate node consists of several runtime modules, however not all of them are used at the same
time. When running a PoA to Substrate bridge the modules required are the Ethereum module and
the currency exchange module. When running a Substrate to Substrate bridge the Substrate and
currency exchange modules are required.

Here's a brief description of each of the runtime modules

### Ethereum Bridge Runtime Module
The main job of the runtime module is to keep track of useful information about the Ethereum chain
which has been submitted by a bridge relayer. This includes:
	- Ethereum headers, and their status (e.g are they the best header, are they finalized, etc)
	- Currency validator set, upcoming validator sets

This runtime module has more resposibilties than simply storing headers and validator sets. It is
able to perform checks on the incoming headers to verify their general integrity, as well as whether
or not they've been finalized (by the Substrate runtime?)


```
â”œâ”€â”€ ethereum
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”‚  â””â”€â”€ src
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ error.rs        // Runtime error handling
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ finality.rs     // Manage finality operations
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ import.rs       // Import new Ethereum headers
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs          // Store headers and validator set info
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ validators.rs   // Track current and future PoA validator sets
â”‚     â””â”€â”€ verification.rs // Verify validity of incoming Ethereum headers
```

### Currency Exchange Runtime Module
### Substrate Bridge Runtime Module


## Ethereum Node
On the Ethereum side of things, we require two things. First, a Solidity smart contract
to track the Substrate headers which have been submitted to the bridge (by the relay), and
a built-in contract to be able to verify that headers have been finalized by the Grandpa
consensus engine.
